# LLMs-for-Classification-and-Text-Generation

**Notebook 1:** Hands-on notebook comparing zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies for sentiment and aspect-based sentiment classification using gold reference examples.

**Notebook 2:** Hands-on notebook comparing concise vs detailed few-shot summarization prompts and assessing output quality using BERTScore and an LLM-based judge.

**Notebook 3:** Hands-on notebook on how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to automate and optimize knowledge-intensive workflows through two real-world case studies: support ticket classification and legal document summarization.
 - The classification workflow explores zero-shot, refined zero-shot, and few-shot prompting (with 4, 8, and 12 examples) to improve routing accuracy and reduce manual effort in customer support operations.
 - The summarization workflow applies few-shot and refined few-shot prompting to generate concise summaries of legal documents, with output quality evaluated using BERTScore and LLM-as-a-Judge.
Together, these examples illustrate how prompt engineering and evaluation strategies can drive operational efficiency and better decision-making across customer service and legal domains.
